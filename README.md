## Movie Rentals Refactoring example

This is the example from chapter 1 of _Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code_
by Martin Fowler.  

The Java code has been updated to use current Java features
such as type parameters in collections, which eliminates the need
for casting, and the for-each loop.

There are two branches:
| Branch   |  Code   |
|----------|---------|
| `java`   | Java code and JUnit tests, in package |
| `python` | Python code and unit tests, w/o packages |


The runnable class movierental.CustomerDemo shows what the
code does.
