## Movie Rentals Refactoring example

This is the example from chapter 1 of _Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code_
by Martin Fowler.  
The Java code has been updated to use current Java features
such as type parameters in collections, which eliminates the need
for casting, and the for-each loop.

Start from the initial commit of code so you can perform
the refactorings yourself.
